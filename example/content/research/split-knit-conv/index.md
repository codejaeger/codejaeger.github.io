## Abstract

Transpose convolutions occur in several image-based neural network applications, especially those involving segmentation or image generation. Unlike regular (forward) convolutions, they result in data access and computation patterns that are less regular, and generally have poorer performance when implemented in software.

## Key Innovation

We present **Split-Knit Convolution (SKConv)** â€“ a technique to replace transpose convolutions with multiple regular convolutions followed by interleaving. This approach transforms irregular memory access patterns into regular ones, enabling better GPU utilization.

## Technical Contributions

- **Algorithm Design**: Novel decomposition of transpose convolutions into regular convolution operations
- **GPU Implementation**: Adaptation of existing software frameworks for GPU implementation of deep neural networks
- **Performance Analysis**: Comprehensive comparison against standard techniques used by popular frameworks

## Results

Our experiments show significant performance improvements over traditional transpose convolution implementations, particularly for:
- **Segmentation Networks**: Improved inference speed for U-Net style architectures
- **Generative Models**: Better performance in GANs and VAEs using transpose convolutions
- **Memory Efficiency**: Reduced memory fragmentation and improved cache utilization

## Impact

This work addresses a fundamental bottleneck in deep learning frameworks, enabling more efficient training and inference of networks that rely heavily on transpose convolutions. The technique is framework-agnostic and can be integrated into existing GPU-accelerated deep learning libraries.

## Technical Details

The split-knit approach decomposes transpose convolutions into:
1. Multiple regular convolution operations
2. Strategic data interleaving
3. Optimized memory layout for GPU architectures

This transformation maintains mathematical equivalence while significantly improving computational efficiency on modern GPU hardware.
